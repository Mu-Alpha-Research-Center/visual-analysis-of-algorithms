Problem difficulties are not always accurate; don't skip easy problems.

<li>
Solve problems for learning algorithms independent of solving random problems.

<ul>
<li>
After you learn a new algorithm or technique, solve several problems to
    reinforce the concept.

<li>
At the same time, solve random problems where you don't know the algorithm
    in advance. This simulate an interview environment.

</ul>
<li>
Practice in a CoderPad sandbox.

<ul>
