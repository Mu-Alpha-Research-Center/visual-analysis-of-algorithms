<ul>
<li>
Buy LeetCode premium. Sort by frequency of problems that appear in real
  interviews and focus on solving mid-medium to low-hard questions.

<li>
Work on problem for 20 min, if you're stuck look at the hints or the solution.
  Whether you've solved it or not, stop working after 45 minutes to simulate
  real-world interview time constraints.

<li>
Find the simplest working solution and move up the ladder of optimization.

<li>
He feels ready to interview once he's solved 100 questions. He feels
  diminishing returns after that. It'll take him 3 weeks, by studying mostly
  on the weekends.

<li>
However, no strategy is perfect, and ultimately, no matter how smart or
  well-prepared you are, tech interviewing can still be a bit of a crapshoot.
  If you get rejected, use the experience to better understand your weak spots
  and further refine your preparation strategy.
