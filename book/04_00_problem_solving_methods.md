## Greedy Algorithms

### Overview

A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not produce an optimal solution, but a greedy heuristic can yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a globally optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time.

### Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm

Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm is a search algorithm that finds the shortest path between a vertex and other vertices in a weighted graph.
