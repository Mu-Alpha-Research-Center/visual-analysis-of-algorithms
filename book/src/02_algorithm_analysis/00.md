## Binary Logarithm

Logarithm is the inverse function to exponentiation which means that the
logarithm of a number n to the base b is the power to which b must be raised
to produce n. The binary logarithm is the power to which the number 2 must be
raised to obtain the value n.

$x=\log _{2}n\quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad 2^{x}=n$

- The number of bits in the binary representation of a positive integer n is the
  integral part of $\log_{2}(n) + 1$.
- The binary logarithm also frequently appears in the analysis of algorithms
  because binary logarithms occur in the analysis of algorithms based on two-way
  branching. If a problem initially has n choices for its solution, and each
  iteration of the algorithm reduces the number of choices by a factor of two,
  then the number of iterations needed to select a single choice is again the
  integral part of $\log_{2}(n)$.

## Amortized Analysis

The motivation for amortized analysis is that looking at the worst-case run time
can be too pessimistic. Instead, amortized analysis averages the running times
of operations in a sequence over that sequence. Amortized analysis is a useful
tool that complements other techniques such as worst-case and average-case
analysis.

Imagine a dynamic list backed by a fixed size array that doubles once capacity
is reached and require n inserts into the new fixed size array.

| n   | # of inserts |
| :-- | :----------- |
| 1   | 1            |
| 2   | 1            |
| 3   | 1            |
| ... | 1            |
| n   | n            |
| ... | n + 1        |

$\text{\# of inserts} \over n$
$\to$
$n + n + 1 \over{n}$
$\to$
$2n + 1 \over n$
$\to$
$2n \over n$
$\to$
$2$
