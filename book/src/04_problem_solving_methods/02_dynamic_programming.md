## Dynamic Programming

To apply DP, must have the following:

1. Optimal substructure - Problem can be broken into sub-problems and solved recursively.
2. Overlapping sub-problems: Recursive algorithm solves the same sub-problems over and over.

If okay, then we can approach in 2 ways.

1. Top-down - Memoize with cache table.
2. Bottom-up - Solve sub-problems first and use their solutions to solve bigger sub-problems.
