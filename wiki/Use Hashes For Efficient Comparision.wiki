= Use Hashes For Efficient Comparison =

By Hachibu

A hash is like thumbprint. You're obviously more complicated than a thumbprint
but it's a reliable way to identify you and so is a hash. Because hashes are
a reliable way to identify things, we can use that property to speed up
comparing things and make your computer go zoom.

Here's a few examples of how hashes are used in real-life.

* Checksums for files.
* Git uses hashes to quickly diff files.
* Image hashing is used for quickly finding duplicate images.
* Browser thumbprinting.

Not only is this technique useful in real-life; we can also apply this pattern
to solve coding challenges. That's a pretty good return on your investment of
time.

* Letter Hash:
  Finding all anagrams in a strings. An anagram is a permutation of string.
  How can you efficiently compare to permutations. Each permutation has
  something in common. They have the same counts of each letter, no matter how
  you rearrange the letters. If you keep track of the counts in an array[26]
  at the end "ab" is `1100...` and "ba" is `1100...`.
