Use Hashes To Efficiently Compare Complex Data Structures

- Git hashes: Comparing trees of files quickly.
- Image hashing: Find duplicate images quickly.
- Letter Hash:
  Finding all anagrams in a strings. An anagram is a permutation of string.
  How can you efficiently compare to permutations. Each permutation has
  something in common. They have the same counts of each letter, no matter how
  you rearrange the letters. If you keep track of the counts in an array[26]
  at the end "ab" is `1100...` and "ba" is `1100...`.
