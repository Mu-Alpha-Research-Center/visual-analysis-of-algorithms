= LeetCode =

* Problem difficulties are not always accurate; don't skip easy problems.
* Solve problems for learning algorithms independent of solving random problems.
  - After you learn a new algorithm or technique, solve several problems to
    reinforce the concept.
  - At the same time, solve random problems where you don't know the algorithm
    in advance. This simulate an interview environment.
* Practice in a CoderPad sandbox.
  - Make sure your language is supported.
  - CoderPad has key bindgs for Vim and Emacs.
