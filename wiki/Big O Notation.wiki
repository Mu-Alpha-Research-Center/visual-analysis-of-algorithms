== What Is Big O? ==

Big O is a mathematical notation for measuring the rate of growth of an
algorithm in terms of time and space. Big O is mainly interesting in counting
the number of operations it takes for an algorithm to complete its job.

The "O" is short for "Order of". So, if we're an algorithm is O(n) then we say
its order of, or rate of growth, is "n" or linear complexity.

Big O notation measures the worst-case scenario so we can place an upper-bound
on the performance of our algorithm. And by upper bound, I mean the maximum
number of operations performed by an algorithm.

| O            | Complexity       |
| O(1)         | Constant         |
| O(log n)     | Logarithmic      |
| O(n)         | Linear           |
| O(n log n)   | Log Linear       |
| O(n^2)       | Quadratic        |
| O(n^3)       | Cubic            |
| O(2^n)       | Exponential      |
| O(n!)        | Factorial        |

== What Is A Logarithm? ==

Logarithms allow us to reverse engineer a power. They are the inverse operation
of exponentiation.

== Constant Time - O(1) ==
Same amount of time no matter the size of n. Add item to end of array.

== Logarithmic Time - O(log n) ==
Dividing input with each iteration. Halving the work. Binary search.

== Linear Time - O(n) ==
Time scales 1:1 as input scales. Linear search.

== Log Linear Time - O(n log n) ==

== Quadratic Time - O(n^2) ==
Time is proportional to the square of the input. Bubble sort.

== Cubic Time - O(n^3) ==


== Exponential Time - O(2^n) ==

== Factorial Time - O(n!)  ==
