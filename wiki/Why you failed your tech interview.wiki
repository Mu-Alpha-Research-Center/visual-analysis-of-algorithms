== Introduction ==
Cramming LeetCode will never cover up a lack of fundamentals. Your interviewers
will not be fooled. Before you start bashing away at a new problem, ask yourself
if you have the right tool for the job; by tool I mean fundamentals.

== Fundamentals ==
* Recursion
  - Draw a diagram
* Algorithmic Analysis
  - Know the runtimes for operations on basic data structures
  - Understand the mergesort analysis
  - Understand the most common amortized analyses

== Environment ==
* Practice on a whiteboard, or coder pad.
* Have a good phone screen setup: headphones, microphone, etc.
