= Two Pointers =

It's similar to the sliding window but now your pointers are moving around
based on certain rules. A good example is two sum on a sorted array.

* Problems with sorted arrays where you need to find a set of elements that
  fulfil certain critera. For, example, two sum on a sorted array.
* The set of elements is a pair, triplet or even a subarray.

== Variations ==
* Low & high pointer: Two sum sorted. Pointers are converging towards
  to the center. This can also work for squaring a sorted array.
* Fan out: Squaring sorted array. Pointers are moving out to the edges
  or fanning out to the ends of the array.
* Sliding window is a variation of 2 pointers. Pointers are moving either
  in lock stop, or dynamically from left to right across the structure.
* Slow pointer fast pointer. One is moving slow and the other is moving fast.
