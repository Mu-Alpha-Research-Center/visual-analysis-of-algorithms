* Something that many easy LeetCode questions have in common is that they
  require you to take a problem that has a O(n^2) solution and bring it down
  to O(n). Usually, these problems have a brute force solution where you compare
  every element with every other element in a double for-loop. The linear
  solution usually involves keeping track of important information using extra
  variables or auxilary data structures.
* Carve out deepwork time when you can be distraction free.
  I like early mornings.
